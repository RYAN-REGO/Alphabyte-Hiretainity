## Description
Hiretainity is a cutting-edge website solution tailored exclusively for companies aiming to streamline their interview processes. Traditional interview procedures often involve manual scheduling, extensive email exchanges, and limited visibility during coding assessments, leading to inefficiencies and delays in the hiring process and hindering the candidate experience.

To address these challenges, our platform offers a seamless, efficient, and transparent approach to conducting interviews. Leveraging advanced technologies and intuitive features, it revolutionizes the way interviews are conducted, enhancing the experience for both recruiters and candidates.

## Challenges we faced while developing the project
During the development of Hiretainity we encountered several challenges that required creative problem-solving and collaboration. These challenges spanned various aspects of the project, including technical, logistical, and user experience considerations. Below are some of the key challenges we faced:
- Inbuilt Compiler:
Developing an inbuilt compiler within the platform presented several technical challenges, including implementing a secure execution environment, supporting multiple programming languages, and ensuring compatibility across different devices and browsers.
- Real-Time Interview AI:
  Integrating real-time interview AI capabilities posed challenges in terms of natural language processing (NLP), speech recognition, and contextual understanding to facilitate dynamic interactions between AI/recuiters and candidates.
- Parsing of Uploaded Excel Files:
Parsing uploaded Excel files into a structured format on the website presented challenges related to data validation, error handling, and compatibility with different Excel file formats and configurations.
- Scheduling Interviews:
Implementing efficient interview scheduling functionality required addressing challenges related to calendar synchronization, time zone management, conflict resolution, and communication with both recruiters and candidates.

By addressing these challenges through innovative solutions, collaborative problem-solving, and iterative development processes, we successfully overcame obstacles and delivered a robust and feature-rich "Innovative Interview Platform" that meets the needs of recruiters and candidates effectively.
